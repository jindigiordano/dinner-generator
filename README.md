##About
Hello chefs! This app stores a database of dishes you know and love to make, and combines them to create a unique balanced meal for you and your dinner guests.

Dishes are sorted into entree, vegetable, and fruit. A dinner menu is generated by randomly selecting a dish from each category.

Congratulations, you now have a balanced meal!

## Heroku App

## Resources

* This app is a recreation of my former command line project [Dinner Generator](https://github.com/jindigiordano/phase-0-tracks/tree/master/8.5%20project)
